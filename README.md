# simply:

A file browser type program, where each entry is a single file, with some internal meta-information.

The file can be (< 400 charaters of)

- markdown
- org-mode

Or a png/img - so that can scan a written note.


# goals
- have 2 top level parts:
  - main tree
  - key terms index
- integrate with emacs and/or standalone
- ability to print x4 cards onto one 1 A4 if needed


# non-goals
- not a wiki
- not an outliner... tree structure is not suppose be moved around
- links are one way (no back links)
- notes are static, can't ever delete them, only add new notes
- no search
- bring your own editor.  We don't need to build a fancy editor.
